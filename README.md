## 🧠 About

**Périlovers in Périgord** is a deliberately nostalgic web project channeling the early 2000s internet: glitter gifs, scrolling banners, and all.  
It's a playful React app that simulates a dating/travel platform for proud Périgord locals.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **CSS** (handcrafted chaos)
- A few lovingly outdated GIFs
- Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) integration

## ✨ Features

- Live visitor counter (yes, it's fake — but charming)
- Google-powered site search
- Flashy banner animation
- Event listing with custom event data
- Banner ads à la 2003
- Responsive to neither device nor reason — and that’s on purpose!
